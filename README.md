<b>Project Title: Proposed Strategies for Customers Retention in Global Bike Incorporation (GBI)</b>

This business intelligence project is one of the projects that I have done during my Data Science master's degree. In this project, I have used a real world dataset from Global Bike Incorporation (GBI) and performed business analysis.

The objective of this project is to analyse the dataset and identify the business problem that is currently faced by GBI. The data visualisation tool that was used in this project is SAP Lumira Discovery. After identifying the business problem using SAP Lumira Discovery and performing business analysis, effective business solutions were proposed to solve the problems.
